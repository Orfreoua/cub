The "cub3d" project, part of the 42 school curriculum, involves creating a basic first-person shooter (FPS) game in C using the MiniLibX graphics library. The project adheres to the strict 42 coding standard, which ensures clean, consistent, and collaborative code.

The main steps include:

Map Creation: Read and store map data from a text file, including walls, empty spaces, objects, and doors.
3D Rendering: Display the map in a graphical window using raycasting to simulate 3D perspective.
Player Movement: Allow the player to navigate the map using keyboard controls, avoiding walls and closed doors.
Textures: Add realistic visuals using .xpm texture files.
By completing these steps, the program can load a map, render it in 3D, enable player navigation, and apply textures for enhanced realism.
